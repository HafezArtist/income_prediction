## Introduction
Income is a key factor in determining individuals’ quality of life and economic decision-making. Predicting income can help businesses, governments, and researchers gain a better understanding of the economic status of a community. This project aims to analyze and predict individuals’ income using various numerical social and economic data.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict individuals’ income based on various features such as age, education, occupation, marital status, and more. This model can assist businesses in hiring decisions and governments in economic policymaking.

## Methodology
The methodology for this project includes the following steps:
- **Data Collection:** Utilize existing datasets related to individuals’ income (e.g., datasets available on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository).
- **Data Preprocessing:** This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
- **Modeling:** Use various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests for income prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Employ evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² to assess model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project may include the following features:
- Age
- Education (level of education)
- Occupation
- Marital Status
- Location (city or state)
- Work Experience (years of experience)

## Expected Results
It is expected that the developed model will be able to predict individuals’ income with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, analyzing the important features in income prediction can help in understanding the factors affecting income.

## Conclusion
This project can serve as a valuable tool for businesses and researchers in analyzing income and making economic decisions. Furthermore, the results of this project can contribute to improving economic and social policies.
